# Fullscren VLC player demo 

[![Build flutter app](https://github.com/jraufeisen/VLC-Player-in-Flutter/actions/workflows/build_flutter_app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jraufeisen/VLC-Player-in-Flutter/actions/workflows/build_flutter_app.yml)

The [`flutter_vlc_player`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vlc_player) package allows you to use the power of VLC player in your flutter app.
However, the `VLCPlayer` widget behaves different from flutter's own `VideoPlayer`. 

This example project shows how to 
* present a video in landscape fullscreen
* scale the video interactively via zoom gestures
* stop autoplaying the video, i.e. workaround for [this bug](https://github.com/solid-software/flutter_vlc_player/issues/335)

See [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66871734/fullscreen-flutter-vlc-player
) on stackoverflow for more guidance.
